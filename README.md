Project 3 CS-210-T3259 Programming Languages
The project that is located in this project was an assignment for CS-210-T3259 Programming Languages via SNHU's computer science program. For this assignment we had to program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. Somethings I felt that I did well within this program was keeping the output clean for user using the program. To enhance the code, I think I'd format the output's different as well as redo the menu to use method calls instead of guts of method in each if. The skills from this project that our transferrable are maniputlating files with ifstream and ofstream. This program is maintainable and adaptable by being able to switch out the input file fairly easy by just changing one line at the start of the program.
